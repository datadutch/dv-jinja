# dv-jinja
building a datavault generator using python jinja templating

# TL;DR
i have some personal goals with this:
* learning how to set up an open source project and collaborate on this with others
* build an easy to use and understandable datavault generator
* learn from contributions made by others

# comments
* i have some experience with Python Jinja, but for this repository, I will start at page 0 using this tutorial: https://realpython.com/primer-on-jinja-templating/

# local implementation
* created the virtual environment manually, using https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

# licensing
from https://choosealicense.com/ i have chosen the GNU GPL v3 license: lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except distributing closed source versions.
